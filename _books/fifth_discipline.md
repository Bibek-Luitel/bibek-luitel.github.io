Peter Sengeâ€™s The Fifth Discipline redefines how organizations learn and adapt by introducing five core practices, with systems thinking at the heart. The book argues that sustainable success comes from cultivating an environment where people grow together and think beyond short-term solutions. It offers a transformative framework for leaders seeking to build resilient, intelligent, and forward-thinking organizations.
