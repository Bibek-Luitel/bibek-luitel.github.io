John Deweyâ€™s Democracy and Education redefines education as the foundation of a thriving democratic society. He critiques traditional education models and advocates for a learner-centered, experiential approach. Dewey positions schools as spaces where individuals learn to engage with society through critical thinking and cooperation.

**##### Key Takeaways**

Education Supports Democracy: A democratic society depends on education that nurtures critical thought, shared understanding, and civic responsibility.

Growth Is the Aim of Education: True education promotes continuous intellectual and moral development, not just the acquisition of fixed knowledge.
