John Dewey’s Democracy and Education redefines education as the foundation of a thriving democratic society. He critiques traditional education models and advocates for a learner-centered, experiential approach. Dewey positions schools as spaces where individuals learn to engage with society through critical thinking and cooperation.

**Key Takeaways**

**Education Supports Democracy**: A democratic society depends on education that nurtures critical thought, shared understanding, and civic responsibility.

**Growth Is the Aim of Education**: True education promotes continuous intellectual and moral development, not just the acquisition of fixed knowledge.

**Interactive Learning Matters**: Learning should be dynamic and rooted in real-life experiences that connect students to their communities and future roles.
