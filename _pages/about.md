I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Educational Leadership](https://www.tamucc.edu/education/departments/edld/index.php) at [Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi](https://www.tamucc.edu/).

 
My research focuses on higher education finance, student financial aid, and the access and affordability of higher education for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. As a scholar, I have co-authored research reports, books, and articles. I have presented my work at notable conferences, including the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the International Council of Professors of Educational Leadership (ICPEL), and the Southwest Educational Research Association (SERA).

I have served in academia for over a decade as a faculty member, teaching management courses to both graduate and undergraduate students. I have worked with nonprofit organizations in various capacities to support the education of underserved populations.

For a comprehensive overview of my work, please refer to my [CV](https://bibekluitel.com/assets/pdf/cv_full_bibekluitel.pdf) and [publications](https://bibekluitel.com/publications/).
