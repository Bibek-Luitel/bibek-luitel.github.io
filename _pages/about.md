I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Educational Leadership](https://www.tamucc.edu/education/departments/edld/index.php) at [Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi](https://www.tamucc.edu/).

 

With a focus on higher education finance, I'm a passionate researcher in educational leadership, diving into student financial aid and loans. My work examines the impact of student financial aid and loans on access and equity. I am interested in leveraging advanced quantitative statistical methods, machine learning, and deep learning to extract actionable insights from complex data. My objective is to engage in scientific inquiry into higher education finance to understand the contradictions, complexities, and nuances in student financial aid.
