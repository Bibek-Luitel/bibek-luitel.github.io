##### Overview
With over a decade of teaching experience, I have served as a main instructor for more than ten graduate and undergraduate courses in management and leadership. My teaching spans institutions affiliated with Tribhuvan University and Bharathiar University in Nepal, where i have delivered foundational and advanced courses in management.

##### Philosophy
I believe effective teaching goes beyond content delivery, it is about fostering curiosity, critical thinking, and practical application. My teaching philosophy centers on learner engagement, contextual relevance, and inclusive pedagogy. I strive to create a dynamic learning environment where students are encouraged to connect theoretical knowledge with real-world challenges.
